## Hi there 👋 my name is Amos Theuri
I am a Computer Information Systems student at Kenya Methodist University (KeMU).
I have a huge interest in software development and linux. I am currently learning web development and linux by using arch as my main operating system. I am also an enthusiast of open source projects and looking to participate in some.
